# Godot AutoGridContainer
An Auto Sizing GridContainer for Godot

Have you ever needed a grid container to hold lots of the same node? Then this is for you! It automagically changes the `coloums` value to fit all of your nodes optimally (a vertical scrollbar appears if not everything can fit)


## This repo contains 2 versions:
- A more simple version. (single gdscript class, doesn't take max height into account, no scrollbar)
- The full version. (godot scene with a script that includes height as a factor)


## See it in action!!
